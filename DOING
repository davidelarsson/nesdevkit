main()
Check whether we have a NES file as a command option.

Do we? -> Load GUI, but don't suggest loading a game. Just load it!

We don't. -> Load GUI and suggest loading a game.


Keeping track of things
-----------------------
Alright. How to send main window around?

Startup code
------------
main()
-> application_start_open()
-> application_start_suggest_open()

application_start_suggest_open()
  Creates main window and adds suggestion text that the user loads a file.
-> file_selected()
-> load_file()

application_start_open()
  Creates main window.
-> EMULATION START!

Signal ends
-----------
load_file()
-> file_selected()

file_selected()
-> EMULATION (RE)START!
