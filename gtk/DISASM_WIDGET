Callbacks needed:

* read_rom
* read_ram
* read_pc

Properties

* read_ram_callback
* read_rom_callback
* address
* auto_read_pc (boolean)

If auto_read_pc is TRUE, the widget will automatically read the PC using its callback and update the address accordingly.
If auto_read_pc is FALSE, the widget will not alter the address when updated, but only re-read memory bytes.
