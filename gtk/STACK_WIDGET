STACK WIDGET
============

Properties:

* ram
* ram_read_callback
* read_sp_callback

Questions:

Do you need the ability to edit memory in this widget? Nah... Unless I find out a more beautiful way of doing so in the memory widget and copy this process to the stack widget.

Public functions:

* stack_widget_update_gui(stack_widget_t *sw);
